I've decided to start learning WebGL. Why WebGL?

1. WebGL is a mature, widely-used web standard.
2. Choosing WebGL over another graphics framework isn't a dead-end; there are
   most certainly lessons I can take away from my experience when I'm ready to
   move on.
3. I can easily share my results on the web.

I usually trust [MDN][1] to be an authoritative source on web technologies, so
I looked there for some starting material. I found this [WebGL tutorial][2] and
I've been working through it [the hard way][3], which is to say I'm typing in
the code myself, without copy-paste, and making sure it runs correctly. I'm at
the point where I've drawn a triangle on the screen ([demo][4]).
