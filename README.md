# Notes on site generation

### Procedures

- Files ending in `.md` are transformed into HTML pages.
- Index files are generated if they do not exist.
- All other files are simply copied.

### Axioms

- Existing directory structure is preserved.

### TODO

- Check for dead links
- Navigation buttons/arrows (e.g. home, up)
- Sort posts newest to oldest
- Show latest update of post
- Optimize images if needed
